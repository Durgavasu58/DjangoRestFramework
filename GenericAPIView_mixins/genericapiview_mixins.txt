----------------------------------------- GenericAPIView  --------------------
This class extends REST framework's APIView class, adding commonly required behaviour for standard list and detail views

Attributes:---  
        1. querset --> The querset  that should be used  be used for returning objects from this view. Typically, must either set this  attribute
                     or override the get_queryset() method. if your are overriding a view method, it is important that you can  call
                     get_queryset() instead of accessing this property directly, as queryset will get evaluated once, and those results
                     will be cached for all subsequent requests.

        2. serillizer_class --> The serializer class that should be used for validating and deserializing input, and for serializing output.
                                Typically, you must either set this attribute, or  overide the get_serializer_class() method

        3. lookup_field --> The model field that should be used to for performing object lookup of  individual model instances. Defaults to 'pk'

        4. lookup_url_kwargs --> The  URL Keyword argument that should be used for object lookup. The URL conf should include a keyword argument
                                corresponding to this value. If unset this defaults to using the  same value as lookup_field.

        5. pagination_class --> The pagination class that should  be used

-----------------------------------------  Mixins --------------------      

One of the big wins of using class based views is that it allows us to easily compose resusable bits of behaviour.

The CRUD operations that been implemented are similar to model-backend APIViews are create.

1. Those bits of common behaviour are implemented in REST Framework's mixin classes
2. The Mixins classes provide the actions that are used to provide the basic view behaviour

* ListModelMixin
* CreateModelMixin
* RetrieveModelMixin
* UpdateModelMixin
* DestroyModelMixin

* ListModelMixin--> It provides a list(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that implements listing a queryset.
                    If the queryset is populated, this returns 200 OK Response, with a serializer representation of the
                    queryset as the body of the response. The response data may optionally be paginated

* CreateModelMixin --> It provides a create(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that implements creating and saving a new model instances.
                    If an object is created this returns a 201 Created Response  with a serializer representation of the
                    queryset as the body of the response. If the Representation contains a key named url, then the Location header of the response will be populated with that value.
