====================================================== TokenAuthentication ===============================================
This Authentication scheme uses a simple token-based HTTP Authentication scheme. Token authentication is appropriated for 
client-server setups,such as native desktop and mobile clients.

To use the TokensAuthentication scheme you'll need to configure the authentication classes to include TokenAuthentication, and additionally include
rest_framework.authtoken in your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

---------Generate Token------
Using Admin Applications
Using Django manage.py command--> python manage.py drf_create_token <username> - This command will return API Token for the given user or Creates a Token if
                                token doesn't exist for user.


------------ How Client can Ask/Create Token ---------------------
 When using Token Authentication you may want to provide a mechanism for clients to obtain a token given the username and password.
 
 REST framework provides a built-in view to provide this behavior. To use it, add the obtain_auth_token view to your URLconf:

 from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token

 urlpatterns = [
    path('gettoken/',obtain_auth_token)
 ]

 The obtain_auth_token vieww will return a JSON response when valid username and password fileds are POSTED to the view using form data or JSON:

   -->   pip install httpie
 --> http POST http://127.0.0.8000/gettoken/ username="name" password="pass"
