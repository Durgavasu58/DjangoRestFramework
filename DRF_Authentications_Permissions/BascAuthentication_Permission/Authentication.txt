---------------------------------------------------  Authentication --------------------------------------
Authentication is the mechanism of assocaiating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials, such as the user
the request came from, or the token that it was signed with. The permission and throttling policies can then  use those 
credentials to determine if the request should be permitted.

REST Framework provides a number of authentication schemes out of the box, and also allows you to implement custom schemes.

* BasicAuthentication
* SessionAuthentication
* TokenAuthentication
* RemoteUserAuthentication
* Custom authentication

* BasicAuthentication --> This authentication scheme uses HTTP Basic Authentication, signed against a user's "username and password"
                         BasicAuthentication is generally only appropriate for testing
    If succesfully authenticated, BasicAuthentication provides the following credentials.
    * request.user will be a Djagno User instance
    * request.auth will be None
    Unauthenticated responses that are denied permission will result in an HTTP 401
    Unauthorized response with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header. For

    example:- 
            WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="api"

Note:-- If you use BasicAuthentication in production you must ensure that your API is only available over https.

        You should also ensure that your API clients will always re-request the username and password at login, and will
        never store those details to presistent storage

---------------------------------------------------  Permission --------------------------------------

1. Permissions are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API.
2. Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed.
3. Permission checks will typically use the authentication information in the request.user and request.auth properties to
    determine if the incoming request should be permitted

------------------------------------------ Permission Clases --------------------------------

Permissions in REST Framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.
* AllowAny
* IsAuthenticated
* IsAdminUser
* IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly
* DjangoModelPermissions
* DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly
* DjangoObjectPermissions
* Custom Permissions
