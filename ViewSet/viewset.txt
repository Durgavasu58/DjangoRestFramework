----------------------------------------- VIEW SET ---------------------------------------
Django REST Framework allows you to combine the logic for set of related views in a single class, called a Viewset.

There are two main advantages of using a Viewset over using a View Class.
    * Repeated logic can be combined into a single class
    * By using routers, we no longer to deal with  wiring up the URL conf ourselves.

----------------------------------------- VIEW SET CLASS ---------------------------------------    
A ViewSet class is simply a type of class-based View, that does not provide any method such as get() or post()
 and instead provides actions such as list() and create()

 * list() --> Get All records 
 * retrieve() --> Get single Record
 * create() --> Create/Insert Record
 * update() --> Update Record Completely
 * partial_update() --> Update Record Partially
 * destroy() --> Delete Record

 During disptach, the following attributes are available on the Viewset:-

 * basename - the base to use for the URL names that are created.
 * action - the name of the current action (e.g., list, create)
* detail - boolean indicating if the current action is configured for a list or detail view.
* suffix -  the dispaly suffix for the viewset. This argument is manually exclusive to suffix
* desciption - the display description for the individual view of a  viewset.
