--------------------------------------------- ModelSerializer Class ---------------
The ModelSerializer class provides a shortcut that lets you automatically create a Serializer class with fields that correspond to the Model fields.

--> The ModelSerializer class is the same as regular serializer class, except that:
	* It will automatically generate a set of fields for you, based on the model.
	* It will automatically generate validators for the serillizer, such as   	 unique_together validators.
	* It includes simple default implementations of create() and update()
